# Project Objective: This report was curated to understand what constitute flight delays, the year it happens the most, month, weekday, the airlines and airports that are predominant, possible causes and recommendations.



----
# Data Sourcing: Data was sourced from NG30DaysofLearning repository https://github.com/theoyinbooke/30Days-of-Learning-Data-Analysis-Using-Power-BI-for-Students/blob/main/Airline%20Project/Airlines.csv



----
# Data Transformation: This was done via power query in Power BI desktop.

# Summary and insights:
I: The Idea behind this report is to understand the factors that foster flight delays between the year 1899-1900.

II: The report is divided into three areas; General Flight Analysis and Airports Delay Analysis.

III: For General Flight Analysis, key metrics such as TOTAL FLIGHTS, AVG DISTANCE OF FLIGHTS, TOTAL DISTANCE, AVERAGE AIR TIME, AVG OF DELAY, FLIGHT BY AIRLINE, FLIGHT BY YEAR, FLIGHT BY MONTH. 

IV: In-depth analysis was conducted in the "Airports Delay Analysis" and also a Dashboard was created to understand some key insights explained below;

-The year 1900 emerged as the year with the most flights recorded (1.13bn) which could e asa result of emergence cheaper air carriers. 
-The month January accounted for the month with the most flights and possible reasons could be due to airlines offering ticket at discounted prices. 
-The SkyWest Airline with the code OO native to Utah, USA recorded the highest number of flights (306,504,153) which could be narrowed down to the possibility of discounted fares, provision for direct flights and good hospitality. 
-Tuesday is the day of the week with the most delays and this can be possibly traced to air traffic or shabby aircraft preparations.
-Atlanta with the code ATL as a departure airport recorded the highest delays (14, 601) and the cause of this could be lack of proper infrastructure to aid the smooth running of operations.
-Geographically, the North America continent, with the USA as the lead country accounted for the highest number of flight delays for departure airports, with ATL top of the list while Denmark in Europe follow behind in second.

# Recommendations: 
I: The Management of SouthWest Airlines which had the most flight delays in the period under review due to adverse weather conditions should endeavor to recruit a metereologist to aid their operations or better still, be up to date with the weather conditions at every point in time in other to to mitigate any possible flight delays and give passengers a worthwhile experience. 

II: The Atlanta International Airport (ATL) which recorded the highest number of flight delays for a departure ariport should put necessary infrastructure in place to prevent any encumbrance that could result in passengers spending needless time at the airport before boarding their flight. 

III: As SkyWest airlines topped the list of airlines with the most flights due to their top notch hospitality and discounted ticket rates, other airlines are urged to emulate such act as it sends a positive message that the airlines pride the comfort of passengers at the very top of their operations. 

NB: This recommendation report is not exhaustive as very few insights could be generated as a result data available
