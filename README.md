# Project Objective: This report was curated to understand what constitute flight delays, the year it happens the most, month, weekday, the airlines and airports that are predominant, possible causes and recommendations.



----
# Data Sourcing: Data was sourced from NG30DaysofLearning repository https://github.com/theoyinbooke/30Days-of-Learning-Data-Analysis-Using-Power-BI-for-Students/blob/main/Airline%20Project/Airlines.csv



----
# Data Transformation: This was done via power query in Power BI desktop.

# Summary and insights:
I: The Idea behind this report is to understand the factors that foster flight delays between the year 1899-1900.

II: The report is divided into two areas; General Flight Analysis and Airports Delay Analysis.

III: For General Flight Analysis, key metrics such as TOTAL FLIGHTS, AVG DISTANCE OF FLIGHTS, AVERAGE AIR TIME, AVG OF DELAY and FLIGHT BY AIRLINE.

IV: In-depth analysis was conducted in the "Airports Delay Analysis" and also a Dashboard was created to understand some key insights explained below;

-The SouthWest Airline with the code WN native to Dallas, USA recorded the most number of flights (94,001) which could be narrowed down to the possibility of discounted fares, provision for direct flights and good hospitality. 
-The SouthWest airline with code WN ranked highest on flight delays (69.4%) and this tells alot about the company's inefficiencies. 
-The ATL airport was discovered to be the airport that has recorded the lowest number of flight delays which can be attributed to their efficient system. 
-The CO airlines are renowned for travelling long distances as they ranked top on the list of Airlines with average distance.
-Tuesday is the day of the week with the most delays and this can be possibly traced to air traffic or shabby aircraft preparations.
-Geographically, the North America continent, with the USA as the lead country accounted for the highest number of flight delays for departure airports, with ATL top of the list while Denmark in Europe follow behind in second.

# Recommendations: 
I: The Management of SouthWest Airlines which had the most flight delays in the period under review due to shortage of personnel should endeavour to recruit more people into the workforce to be able to meet the needs of customers and give them a worthwhile experience. 


NB: This recommendation report is not exhaustive as very few insights could be generated as a result data available
